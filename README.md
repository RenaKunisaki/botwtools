Breath of the Wild modding tools by Rena

Able to extract several file types found in BotW (and maybe other games).

Usage: `python botwtools` or `./botwtools/__main__.py`

Requires Python 3 and modules:
    - PyYAML
    - sortedcontainers

Uses third-party libraries:
    - libyaz0 by MasterVermilli0n / AboodXD
    - byml-v2 by leoetlino <leo@leolam.fr>

This program is only tested on Linux, but probably works fine on Windows too.
