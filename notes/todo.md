- model exporting:
    - skeletons
    - bounding box
    - FMAT:
        - actually use:
            - render params
            - shader params
            - shader assign/mat params
        - figure out purpose and format of...
            - sampler list
            - volatile flag
            - unk30, 40, B4
            - mat_flags
            - various dicts
            - user data (if ever used)
            - names at beginning of ShaderAssign struct
                - is this an appropriate name?
            - shader param fields unk0, unk14, idx0, idx1
            - is `TexInfo.txt` used?
        - don't hardcode `geometry0_lod0_src4` as sampler texcoord
        - figure out proper way to tell what each texture is used for
        - figure out why Blender is ignoring the `_Nrm` textures, and how to get the `_Spm` textures to be used for specular intensity rather than specular color - I can't see any difference in a file exported from Blender?

    - other attributes
    - check out if fox SPM textures are being exported correctly; they look funny.
- figure out what dicts are about
