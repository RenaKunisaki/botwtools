- model exporting:
    - skeletons
    - bounding box
    - FMAT render params, shader params
        - don't hardcode `geometry0_lod0_src4` as sampler texcoord
        - figure out proper way to tell what each texture is used for
        - figure out why Blender is ignoring the `_Nrm` textures, and how to get the `_Spm` textures to be used for specular intensity rather than specular color - I can't see any difference in a file exported from Blender?
    - FSKA (Skeleton Animation)
    - FMAA (Material Animation)
    - FVIS (Visual Animation)
    - FSCN (Scene Animation)
    - FSHU (Shape Animation)
    - other attributes
    - check out if fox SPM textures are being exported correctly; they look funny.
- figure out what dicts are about
